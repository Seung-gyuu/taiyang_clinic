## Deployment

#### Prerequisites : 

Before deploying the project, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

AWS Account: Create an AWS account to provision the necessary resources. 

AWS EC2: Set up an EC2 instance to host your application.

AWS RDS: Create an RDS instance for your database.

Git Bash: Install Git Bash to clone the project repository and execute Git commands.

FileZilla: Install FileZilla for transferring files to the server or hosting environment



#### Configuration: 

Configure the security groups on your EC2 instance with the following settings:

Set up the security grous on EC2
- 8080 : tomcat server 
- 3306 : mysql port
- 80 : http



#### Install dependencies:

1. Open Gitbash
2. Connect to ip address

``` ssh -i keypairpath ubuntu@ec2 ip address ```

3. Install JDK

``` 
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openjdk-8-jdk 
```

4. Install tomcat server 

```
wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.0.27/bin/apache-tomcat-8.0.27.tar.gz
-unzip
tar -zvxf apache-tomcat-8.0.27.tar.gz
```



#### Database setup:

1) Download the MySQL repository

``` wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql-apt-config_0.8.12-1_all.deb ```

2) After the MySQL package has been successfully downloaded, install it
``` sudo dpkg -i mysql-apt-config_0.8.12-1_all.deb ```

3) select ubuntu bionic -  MySQL Server & Cluster option - select mysql-5.7 -select Ok

4) update the APT repository
``` sudo apt update```

5) If you encounter the "signature couldn't be verified" error like this one: NO_PUBKEY 467B942D3A79BD29, you will need to import the missing gpg key by running the following command:

``` sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys 467B942D3A79BD29 ```

6) execute the apt update again:
``` sudo apt update ```

7) Now that you have a MySQL 5.7 repository in your system, you can proceed to install it. For this, run the following command:

``` sudo apt install -f mysql-client=5.7* mysql-community-server=5.7* mysql-server=5.7* ```
